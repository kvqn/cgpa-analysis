# DTU Archive

A web application to easily access past result information for Delhi Technological University.

To see how to results are scraped and stored, check out [kvqn/dtu-archive-migrations](https://github.com/kvqn/dtu-archive-migrations).

### Why I made this?

I wanted to compare the different courses offered by the university and there didn't exist any solutions.

This is my gift to you, the analytical ones, that will spend their time fretting over choices they have and over analysing everything.
